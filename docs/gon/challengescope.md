#### GoN Challenge Scope

<br/>

# Incentivized
# Testing Rules

<br/>
<br/>

The GoN Incentivized Testing phase is currently underway.

<br/>

Before you start, make sure to check out the rules and requirements on this page.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## Overview

<br/>

> Please note that this is not the full version and will be supplemented as the game proceeds. You can visit the [GoN GitHub page](https://github.com/game-of-nfts/gon-testnets) for details.

<br/>
 
Through the several rounds in phase 1, participants are expected to gain knowledge and build an understanding of Interchain NFTs and help discover interesting attack vectors.

<br/>

Testnet infrastructure:
>Participants will utilize all GoN testnets for feature-testing, and for completing multiple tasks.
* ICS-721 Enabled SDK and Wasm Chains
* ICS-721 IBC Channels and Ports
* Support Services in Cosmos Discord
* Testnet Faucets
* Testnet Explorers

<br/>

üí¨ Event coordinators will be available in the [Cosmos Network Discord](https://discord.gg/cosmosnetwork) #üêá‚îágon-testnet channel.

<br/>

üìç The scorecard page is now available, visit [here](https://interchainnfts.dev/gon/scorecard.html).

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## Join & Evidence Submission

<br/>

According to information provided via the [registration form](https://forms.gle/UCyfH9fjpKLHqWGB9) , eligible participants have been invited into [Cosmos Network Discord](https://discord.gg/cosmosnetwork) #üêá‚îágon-testnet channel to start coordinating their participation.

<br/>

Before you start testing, please kindly check the join & evidence submission guidance provided at [gon-evidence](https://github.com/game-of-nfts/gon-evidence).

<br/>

In order to verify the authenticity of identity, ensure fairness of the game, and protect participants' rights in receiving points and claiming rewards, please make sure to submit evidence as required.

<br/>

***Please note that all submissions will be public, so please make sure to create new addresses of test chains to participate in the public testing.***

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## Timeline

<br/>

The incentivized testing phase has 3 stages with different tasks. Tasks will be revealed gradually as the game progresses.

<br/>

Participants can refer to the [installation doc](https://github.com/game-of-nfts/gon-testnets/blob/main/doc/installation.md) to install the client software and the [instruction doc](https://github.com/game-of-nfts/gon-testnets/blob/main/doc/instruction-ics721.md) to get familiar with Interchain NFTs Transfer operations.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

### Stage 1: Welcome to GoN

<br/>

**Started from Mar 1**
* Create Collections and NFTs
* Perform Interchain NFTs Transfer

<br/>

#### Round 1: Warm-ups
IRISnet, Stargaze, Juno, Uptick and OmniFlix have prepared their testnets, allowing participants to create their collections and NFTs. These NFTs can be used for the next transfer tasks of the game, marking the first time participants can experience Interchain NFT Transfer.

<br/>

#### Rules:
* Participant issue their own classes and must set class data as the JSON string below
* This allows participants to bind their classes(collections, denoms) to their GitHub account and prove that they have control over the class owner
* All the following tasks related to NFT transfer must be minted under their classes
* Class owner must be the IRISnet address of the participant at the time of registration
```
{
  "github_username": "username, this is a must",
  "discord_handle": "discord handle, this is optional",
  "team_name": "your team name, this is optional",
  "community": "if you come from a community"
}
```
<br/>

#### Tasks:
A1,A2,A3,A4,A5,A6

<br/>

### Stage 2: Let's Dive into Interchain NFTs Transfer

<br/>

**Started from Mar 6**
* Perform Interchain NFT Transfer through different flows

<br/>

#### Round 2: Journey for One
Participants complete Interchain NFTs Transfer independently, which means they need to perform operations using their own account addresses on each chain. For each task, participants should start transferring with a different NFT. As a result, they need to create multiple NFTs under their collections.

<br/>

#### Rules:
* Each NFT can only be used as evidence once for tasks in Round 2.
* Participants must use NFT minted under classes/denoms they issued in Round 1.
* Participants must use their own account addresses provided at the registration stage.
* Flow can be queried off-chain with flow-id.

<br/>

#### Tasks:
A7~A20

<br/>

### Stage 3: Enjoy the Carnival of GoN

<br/>

**Started from Mar 13**
* Competitive individual race
* Quiz game
* ‚Ä¶

<br/>

#### Round 3: Competitive Individual Race
Participants receive NFT airdrops on IRISnet and perform Interchain NFT Transfer through specified flows in Task Data. The airdrop has two rounds: In the first round, all participants go through the same flow, and in the second round, all participants go through different flows.

<br/>

The first round airdrop will start at around 2023-03-15-06:00 UTC, and the second round airdrop will start at around 2023-03-16-06:00 UTC. Before that, participants can prepare their strategies. Please make sure that you have been added to the `gon-evidence` repository and your information is correct, otherwise, you may not receive the airdrop!

<br/>

**Task Data:**
```
{
  "type": "individual race round",
  "flow": "the flow id, check flow with flow-id on https://github.com/game-of-nfts/gon-testnets/blob/main/doc/flow-table.md",
  "last_owner": "the ultimate owner of this NFT",
  "start_height": "transfer before this height are considered valid"
}
```

<br/>

**Rules:**
- The `flow` can be queryied with `flow-id` [here](https://github.com/game-of-nfts/gon-testnets/blob/main/doc/flow-table.md).
- The `start_height` is the block height on IRISnet. Any transfer prior to the `start_height` will be considered invalid.
- Participants must use their own account addresses provided at the registration stage.
- The `last_owner` is an official address on IRISnet. After finishing the interchain NFT transfer, every participant transfer the NFT to `last_owner` then complete the race.
- Considering the time zone difference, the completion time is calculated by the difference in height between the last NFT transfer (to the `last_owner`) and the first interchain NFT transfer on IRISnet.
- The participant with the smallest difference in block height will rank higher, and in case of a tie, the ranking will be based on the height of the last transfer, with the participant having the lower height ranking higher.
- The end of round 3 will be at `2023-03-17-23:59:59 UTC`. The height of evidence will be considered invalid if completed after the corresponding block height.

<br/>

#### Tasks:
B1, B2, B3, B4

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## Point System

<br/>

### General Tasks
General tasks allow participants to fully experience the NFT-transfer functionality. The deadline for the general task submissions (stage 1&2) originally due on the 13th will be extended to around 27th, considering that more testing would be better.Participants must submit evidence generated before then (based on the specified block height). Details of flow and flow style in the task description can be found [here](./doc/flow-table.md).
